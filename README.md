# txt2srt
quick python script to make a dummy .srt caption file from a text file.

Created by decimae with some help from glumbaron/robbyblum

VodBox has a Javascript version at https://github.com/VodBox/txt2sub.js

run `python txt2srt.py` for a gui-based interface

run `python test.py` to see how to use the out-of-date text-based version
